This folder contains the **Jupyter Notebooks** used for cleaning and exploring the datasets in this project.

Each notebook includes:
- Step-by-step cleaning and preprocessing code
- Explanations of data issues (null values, outliers, duplicates)
- Comments and summaries at each stage of transformation

All notebooks were developed in **Google Colab** using Python and Pandas, and are reproducible from the raw datasets stored in `Raw_data/`.
