This folder contains the **cleaned and processed versions** of the original datasets found in the `raw_data/` directory.

Each dataset here has been:
- De-duplicated
- Checked for null/missing values
- Standardized (e.g. column naming, units, data types)
- Exported for analysis or machine learning use

These outputs are the result of the cleaning workflows documented in the `notebooks/` folder. They are ready to be used for further analysis, modeling, or dashboarding.

 Note: File names follow the same convention as their raw counterparts for easy reference.
